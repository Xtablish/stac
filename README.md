# STAC
STAC is an AI application built for language translation and communication on the go, it uses image recognition and speech-to-text to communicate in different languages. This allows the user to focus on the conversation instead of worrying about the language barrier. STAC uses TensorFlow machine learning for face recognition, language detection and language translation.

## Usage
STAC is built with ease of use and smooth UX implementation to make its usage user-friendly and adaptive. It features multi-factor authentication (MFA), which aimed at providing better security posture and flexibility to authenticate. There's the option to login with email and password, which uses Firebase cloud services API on the backend to host the database. This process will be unavailable when there's no internet connection. Which is why STAC also uses TensorFlow for facial recognition, this option is not as secure as the first one, but it will be hosted locally.

## Dev Logs
Security without functionality is pointless, because you can't protect something that doesn't work. So, STAC is function focused and is primarily built using Java and XML.
